# Towards a verified compiler from a C-like language to RISC-V

Tested with Coq 8.7.0

Dependency: The [Bedrock Bitvector Library (bbv)](https://github.mit.edu/plv/bbv/) should be a sibling directory of the `compiler` directory.

Building: First run `make` in the `bbv` directory, then run `make` in the `compiler` directory.
